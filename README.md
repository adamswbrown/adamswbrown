# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam

👨‍💻 **Principal Consultant — Cloud Modernization, FinOps & Migration Strategy**

I design the systems that tell organisations **what should move, how it should change, and why it matters financially**.

Most cloud projects fail because they start with technology.  
I start with decision logic — then automate the implementation.

My work sits between architecture, finance, and operations: turning discovery data into clear modernization actions instead of endless workshops and spreadsheets.

## 🧭 What I Actually Do

I don’t just migrate workloads — I build the decision systems that tell you what should happen to them.

Typical outcomes of my work:

- Raw discovery data → modernization strategy
- Cloud cost → financial narrative
- Architecture complexity → actionable plan
- Manual processes → automated workflows
- Assessments → migration waves
